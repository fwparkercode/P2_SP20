# Folium train map


# 15pts - Use folium to plot all of the L train stops in Chicago. Use an appropriate start zoom level.
# 5pts - Add the name to each stop as a popup. Add a train icon to each marker.  Save as an html page in the same folder.
# 3pts  - Color code all of the lines (make the pink line marker pink etc.)
# 2pts - Brown is not a default color name.  See if you can use the documentation for Folium to set a marker color through other means.

# Data set is in this folder, but can be found at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/8pix-ypme/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD

# Tricky parts of this one
## The location is in tuple format.  If you have trouble converting it, try this:
my_string = '(41.2, -87.9)'
my_tuple = eval(my_string)
print(my_tuple)
print(type(my_tuple))


# If you have extra time, try to put some html into the popup.
